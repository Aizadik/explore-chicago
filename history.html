                <p> The history of Chicago begins in the year 1673. In that year two Frenchmen, Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet arrived in the area. (The name Chicago is derived from a Native American word of uncertain meaning, checagou). However the French
                    did not settle the area. The first non-indigenous person to make his home in the area was an African American from the Caribbean called Jean Baptiste Point du Sable who built a house there in 1779. Then in 1803 the American government
                    built a fort called Fort Dearborn.</p>

                <p> In the 1830s Chicago grew rapidly. Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 although it only had a population of a few hundred. However Chicago mushroomed and by 1837 it had a population of 4,000. In that year Chicago was made a city.
                    Chicago also became the transport hub of the USA. The Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848 and by 1860 15 railroad companies had a terminus in Chicago. The city became famous for meat packing and in 1865 the Union Stock Yards
                    opened.

                <p> In the last years of the 19th century Chicago continued to grow at an astonishing rate. Meanwhile the World's first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building was erected in 1884. Other famous buildings of late 19th century Chicago are the
                    Rookery, built in 1888 (its lobby was redesigned by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1905) and the Fine Arts Building, built in 1885. The World's Columbian Exhibition was held in Chicago in 1893. It was held in Jackson Park.</p>

                <p> Meanwhile a notorious event in the history of Chicago was the St Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. Al Capone planned to kill his enemy, a man named George 'Bugs' Moran. So at 10.30 am on 14 February, St Valentine's Day, a car went to a
                    garage on North Side. The car was the type used by detectives and it had police insignia painted on it. Inside it were two men dressed as policemen. There were also two men in civilian clothes posing as plainclothes detectives in the
                    car.
